# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Key Roles in Planning
- **Project Manager**: Facilitates planning, manages timelines and risks
- **Product Manager**: Defines requirements and prioritizes backlog
- **Developer**: Estimates work and identifies technical dependencies
- **QA Lead**: Defines testing approach and quality gates
- **UX Designer**: Scopes design work and ensures usability requirements
- **DevOps Engineer**: Identifies infrastructure and deployment needs

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Dev, QA, UX, DevOps)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager + UX Designer)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points with Developers)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including quality gates (QA Lead input)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (all roles)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (PM + Release Manager)
7. Establish testing strategy and automation plan (QA Lead + DevOps Engineer)
8. Plan design deliverables and review cycles (UX Designer + Product Manager)
