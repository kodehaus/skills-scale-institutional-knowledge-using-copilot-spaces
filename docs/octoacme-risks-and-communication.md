# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Release Manager communicates deployment schedules and release status
- QA Lead reports on quality metrics and testing progress
- DevOps Engineer provides infrastructure and deployment updates
- UX Designer shares design progress and usability findings

## Communication Templates

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- Quality issues: QA Lead → PM → Product Lead
- Design/UX issues: UX Designer → Product Manager → Design Lead
- Infrastructure/deployment issues: DevOps Engineer → PM → Infrastructure Lead
- Release coordination issues: Release Manager → PM → Product Lead
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call
